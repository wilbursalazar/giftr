Are you hankering for a great GIF? Using this handy search function, you can pull up a grid of curated GIFs for your viewing pleasure. More than this, they will render simultanously for you. 

## Tech Stack

HyperText Markup Language, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, and my favorite markup language: Markdown.

## What I'd Improve

1. Add a filter function to filter by popularity and resolution
2. Add a link feature where clicking on a GIF reveals others similar to it
3. Add a hashtag function that allows you to add search tags to GIFs (like #funny, #weird, #meme, #frogs, etc.)a
